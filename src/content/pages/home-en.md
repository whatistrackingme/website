You leave your home, go outside, other people or companies take pictures of you
without your consent or sometimes even knowledge.
This is normalized in our current society.

Previously these pictures were never exposed to anyone,
except if the person consciously shared them on social media or in person.

**This has changed.**

To keep the AI train running and to sell more personalized ads, companies chose to process and automatically
upload the pictures and videos you gladly offered to them for a "free" service.
In most cases they will aggressively coerce you to sign a hundred-page terms of service, where you surrender your rights.
If you don't agree, you can't use their service and everyone just agrees as they don't see a choice.

A prominent example is Meta.

> If you see a "cloud processing" pop-up on Facebook and tap Allow, you're agreeing to Meta's AI Terms of Service and permitting your "media and facial features" to be analyzed by Meta's AI.
> Once enabled, Facebook continuously uploads photos from your camera roll to Meta's cloud to surface "hidden gems" and suggest creative edits or collages.

But it does not end with a single company.
To make things worse, regulators in several countries consider and plan requirements to certain companies to scan pictures on your
phone for illegal content, regardless of their business terms of service.
This opened the doors of acceptance for on-device scanning and processing of your personal data.

## What Now?

This project aims to help you and us understand where, when, what, and maybe who is digitally tracking
you in real life, even if you don't own smart devices.

We approach this in a technical way, but cannot succeed without collaboration with the community.
Therefore we are dependent on people using our project and donating their (anonymized) data as a conscious decision.
Help us find answers, or at least get closer.
Maybe it will also be useful in a regulatory debate to make sure we retain or gain
the privilege of consent in real life, which we lost in digital life.
